## About

I am a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate in Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University, within the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/). I am advised by [Amir Zeldes](https://gucorpling.org/amir/), and I am a member of the [Corpling Lab](https://gucorpling.org/corpling/) and [GUCL: Computational Linguistics @ Georgetown](https://gucl.georgetown.edu/). I received my B.A. with a triple major in Linguistics, Computer Science, and Asian Studies, and a minor in Cognitive Science from Cornell University in 2018. Before coming to Georgetown, I worked as a Senior Computational Linguist at [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/), where I continue to work part-time. 

## Research Interests

My research focus is on various types of **non-identity coreference**, including bridging (also called associative coreference) and near identity coreference. I am also broadly interested in **corpus linguistics** (including corpus construction and linguistic annotation) and **computational semantics**.
