## About

I am a final year Ph.D. Candidate in Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University, within the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/). I am advised by [Amir Zeldes](https://gucorpling.org/amir/), and I am a member of the [Corpling Lab](https://gucorpling.org/corpling/) and [GUCL: Computational Linguistics @ Georgetown](https://gucl.georgetown.edu/). I received my B.A. with a triple major in Linguistics, Computer Science, and Asian Studies, and a minor in Cognitive Science from Cornell University in May 2018, and I received my M.S. in Computational Linguistics from Georgetown University in December 2024. Before coming to Georgetown, I worked as a Senior Computational Linguist at [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/), where I continue to work part-time. 

## Research Interests

My research focus is on various types of **associative anaphoric phenomena**, including bridging anaphora and near-identity coreference relations. I am also broadly interested in **corpus linguistics** (including corpus construction and linguistic annotation) and **computational semantics**.
