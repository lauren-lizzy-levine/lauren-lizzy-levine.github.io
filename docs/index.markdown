## About

I am a second year PhD student in Computational Linguistics at Georgetown Univeristy, within the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/). I am advised by [Amir Zeldes](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/amir/), and I am a member of the [Corpling Lab](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/corpling/) and [GUCL: Computational Lingusitics @ Georgetown](https://gucl.georgetown.edu/). I received my B.A. with a triple major in Linguistics, Computer Science, and Asian Studies, and a minor in Cognitive Science from Cornell University in 2018. Before coming to Georgetown, I worked as a Senior Computational Linguist at [The MITRE Coporation](https://www.mitre.org/), where I continue to work part time.
